# 1. Init Delivery Service

Date: 2024-01-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a service to manage delivery operations for the shop boundary. The service should handle:
- Package lifecycle management
- Courier management
- Order assignment and dispatching
- Delivery tracking

## Decision

Create a Delivery Service implemented in Rust with:
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture
- CQRS pattern for commands and queries
- Event Sourcing for package and courier state changes
- gRPC API for service communication

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rust provides memory safety and high performance
- DDD ensures clear domain boundaries
- Event Sourcing enables full audit trail of deliveries

### Negative
- Rust has a steeper learning curve
- Need to maintain proto definitions separately
