## Context

ShortLink brand growth has created demand for branded merchandise, providing an opportunity for a new revenue stream.

## Goal

Expand the ShortLink product line to include merchandise, aiming to increase revenue and enhance customer engagement.

## Decision

Partner with a third-party provider to manage the ADR Merch Service, with ADR overseeing design approvals and brand alignment. 
The backend technology will initially be Golang, with a view to potentially adopting a microservice's architecture as the service grows.

## Consequences

The new service facilitates brand monetization with less strain on core operations but introduces dependency 
on a third-party provider. Mitigation strategies include maintaining open communication lines and robust monitoring systems.
