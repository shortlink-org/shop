Date: 2024-01-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The **"Shop Boundary"** within our software system is designed to enhance the management of goods and services related 
to our core offerings. This boundary is crucial for segregating the functionalities that handle different aspects 
of our shop's operations, making the system more organized and efficient.

## Decision

We have established the Shop Boundary with the following services, each tailored to meet specific operational needs of our shop:

- **Merch Service:** Manages the merchandise store functionalities. Implemented in Go with Dapr, 
this service is responsible for all merchandise-related operations.
- **Cart Service:** Handles the shopping cart functionalities. Developed in C#, 
it manages user sessions and cart operations ensuring a smooth shopping experience.
- **Admin Service:** Administers the backend shop operations. Using Python and Django, 
this service allows for comprehensive management of the shop's backend processes, 
including product management and user access control.
- **Order Service (OMS):** Manages the order processing functionalities. Developed in Temporal,
this service ensures efficient order management, tracking, and processing.

Each service is equipped with its own documentation and operational status indicator, accessible through provided links, 
ensuring transparency and ease of maintenance.

## Consequences

The initiation of the Shop Boundary brings several benefits:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each service focuses on a specific aspect of the shop's functionality, 
reducing complexity and enhancing maintainability.
- **Scalability:** Modular design allows each service to scale independently based on demand.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** With dedicated documentation and status indicators for each service, 
ongoing maintenance and updates are streamlined and more manageable.

This decision aligns with our strategic goal to build a robust, scalable, and maintainable system 
that supports our business operations efficiently.
