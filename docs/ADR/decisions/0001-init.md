# 1. Init Shop Boundary context

Date: 2024-01-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The **"Shop Boundary"** within our software system is designed to enhance the management of goods and services related 
to our core offerings. This boundary is crucial for segregating the functionalities that handle different aspects 
of our shop's operations, making the system more organized and efficient.

## Decision

We have established the Shop Boundary with the following services, each tailored to meet specific operational needs of our shop:

- **Admin Service:** Administers the backend shop operations. Using Python and Django, 
this service allows for comprehensive management of the shop's backend processes, 
including product management (CRUD for goods), user access control, and data generation for testing.

- **Order Management Service (OMS):** Manages cart and order processing functionalities. Developed in Go with Temporal workflows,
this service handles shopping cart operations, order lifecycle management, and ensures efficient order tracking and processing.

- **Pricer Service:** Handles dynamic pricing and discount policies. Implemented in Go with OPA (Open Policy Agent),
this service applies discount rules, taxes, and pricing policies to cart items.

- **UI Service:** Customer-facing web application. Built with Next.js and React,
this service provides the shopping experience including product browsing, cart management, and checkout.

- **BFF (Backend for Frontend):** GraphQL API gateway. Aggregates data from multiple backend services
and provides a unified API for the UI service.

Each service is equipped with its own documentation and operational status indicator, accessible through provided links, 
ensuring transparency and ease of maintenance.

## Consequences

The initiation of the Shop Boundary brings several benefits:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each service focuses on a specific aspect of the shop's functionality, 
reducing complexity and enhancing maintainability.
- **Scalability:** Modular design allows each service to scale independently based on demand.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** With dedicated documentation and status indicators for each service, 
ongoing maintenance and updates are streamlined and more manageable.
- **Technology Diversity:** Each service uses the most appropriate technology stack for its domain
(Python/Django for admin, Go for high-performance services, Next.js for UI).

This decision aligns with our strategic goal to build a robust, scalable, and maintainable system 
that supports our business operations efficiently.
